# Materials for training:
## Topic 1. Servlets to add.
## Topic 2. Java8.
1. Implement observer pattern: 
Use emulated interface of servlets observer.ServletRequestListener
(We are using String as event not javax.servlet.ServletRequestListener for study purposes.)

2. Refactoring old-style java code to functional java8 style:
  * Create tests to cover the logic of method. (Check the OldJavaToRefactorTest.java it already has 
  implementation of testLoanSum as the example).
  * Refactor methods in OldJavaToRefactor class to java8 approach.
  * Check that all tests are Green.
